Ever since buying my iPad2 in March I have always wanted to write a blog post and send it live from the magical device, I even bought a wireless keyboard to make the process easier. I believe that there is something quite fantastical about being able to write in the peace and quiet of wherever you want (in my case the lounge with the calming clock tick-tock and the blue sky and sunshine out of the window) having no constraint to be in front of the computer screen. With the WordPress app I am able to do all this and send it "live" where it goes straight to this site, or "pending review" where I can edit it on the Wordpress admin area, or if I want to add further links and photos to the post, before publishing to live at a later date.
