I thought that I would be playing badminton right now. Instead I am at home typing into my computer. That's a bad swap and it happened because of a mix-up with my friend Rob (my fault). Anyway now I am at home and doing some typing. Typing is good for the soul I think, and the more you type the easier it becomes. In my last job I was continually brain deprived (i.e. by monotonous boring brain numbing work) so my ability to type sentences withered and almost died away. That's why I am trying to write in this blog more. To bring back my brain from the abyss.
