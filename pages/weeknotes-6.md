description:I've done a lot of learning this week and also I went for a big family walk last Sunday.---

This week has mostly been about:

*   Started [WesBos' new Advanced React and GraphQL course](https://advancedreact.com/) that I won after catching a paper airplane at a conference earlier this year - thanks [Wes](https://twitter.com/wesbos)!.Â   
    
*   Demos on CodePen ([knockout text](https://codepen.io/bigandy/pen/xygaLQ)), [gradient text](https://codepen.io/bigandy/pen/ReoYzK), [clip-path](https://codepen.io/bigandy/pen/YJWyMw), and [background-blend-mode](https://codepen.io/ventureharbour/pen/wYgbLE).
*   Went for a long walk with Arthur, Emma and Marion last Sunday exploring the countryside around our new home.
