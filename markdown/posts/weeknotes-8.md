This week was a busy one.

*   We went to France for my brother-in-law's wedding each way taking 3 seperate trains and two different taxis - with two kids it was exhausting! 
*   It was my birthday and Marion and I went out for a nice dinner in Wallingford
*   Fireworks display at Cholsey Meadows
*   Visited my Bro in London
