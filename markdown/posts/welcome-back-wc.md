Running: Monday 27.08: "Wellington College+" 23 mins. Had to alter route cause the gates at the far end of the kilometer driver in WC were closed (as it was a bank holiday). Set off on a flier and would have knocked off more time from record if had been the usual route. Suffering from a sore throat I didn't go running today, opting instead to sleep sleep and read Harry Potter.
