hi Thomas! Yes I booked the test for Monday next week! My contract with Computeach ends in July and I want to get started on the final module before then... which means I have to pass the exam and get cracking on the next one! How is your coursework going? When are you hoping to take the exam? How are you finding the course so far? You mentioned that you were working on websites for friends, how is that going? Thanks for the message, Andrew
