This week has been mostly about:

*   Learning loads about Gatsby, setting up [andrewhudson.me](https://andrewhudson.me) using Gatsby v2 including creation of a couple of plugins to pull in data from this site, and Strava.
*   Going to Marwell Zoo with Arthur, Emma, Marion and my parentsÂ   
    
*   Reading a couple of chapters from [Smashing Magazine Book 6](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/09/smashing-book-6-release/) ("Custom Variables" and "Bringing Personality Back To The Web").
*   Watching the World Championship Road Race on TV
