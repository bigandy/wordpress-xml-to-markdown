Running : "Mapledurham" is a new route that Mike and I ran this lunchtime for the first time. The [Route](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=877586) is 6.71 miles and it took us 51 mins. The temperature was hot and it was a good even pace (although if I were doing it solo I think I would have gone faster.) Average Pace = 7.36 min/mile.
