Thank god for short weeks in May (there are 2) which allow for escape into the countryside. We went to Dorset via the New Forest, camping on the coast near Lyme Regis. After an exceptionally warm April the temperature turned down and we were buffeted by heavy showers and cold wind. Walking along the coast, searching for fossils on the beach, and getting fresh country air. Finally we finished by visiting Lulworth Cove, a beautiful coastal village, for sunshine icecream and more walking. At the end of May we're off to the Brecon Beacons for the 6th Pidgeon Walking Weekend with 20+ family. Cannot wait!
