About Me
========

I'm a front-end and JavaScript developer based in Wallingford, Oxforshire, UK. Outside of work I love running, experimenting with my Raspberry Pi, taking photographs, and listening to music. I'm husband of Marion and father of Arthur. I specialise in front-end and JavaScript development I love working with HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JavaScript and WordPress. I relish optimising code and development processes with tools and standards.

This Site
---------

This site is powered by WordPress on [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main). I have secured everything with ssl/tls and it utilises [http/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) (h2) and is **https**://big-andy.co.uk with the power of [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). The theme is built on top of the Zurb Foundation 5 Grid pure CSS. Code linting and concatenation and minification, autoprefixing, uncss, criticalcss, svg optimisation is all handled by [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and CSS is compiled by [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) SCSS (easier to use Chrome Devtools Workspaces with sass). For the typography I am using Open Sans from Google Fonts via the [Google Webfont Helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) (I can self-host giving a 100/100 pagespeed insights score)... combined with [localFont](http://jaicab.com/localFont/) I can inline the font in base-64 format in [opensans.css](https://big-andy.co.uk/content/themes/v5/build/css/fonts/opensans.css) and then cache in the browser's localStorage. [All my code is on Github](https://github.com/bigandy/big-andy.co.uk).
